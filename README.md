# PUSHSWAP

Pushswap is a project that you may encounter in your coding journey. Its purpose is to teach you some basic operations in data structures, specifically stacks. It focuses on the concept of sorting data in a stack using a limited set of operations.

# Installation

To get started, clone the repository and compile the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agathabarros/42-push_swap.git
cd pushswap
make 
```

# Usage

Execute the program using the following command:

```bash
./push_swap [list of integers]
```

# Arguments:

list of integers: A sequence of different integers that will be sorted.

# Example:

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1 6 5 8
```
In this example, the program push_swap takes the sequence of integers 3 2 1 6 5 8 and sorts them in ascending order using a predefined set of operations. The output will be the operations used to sort the list.
